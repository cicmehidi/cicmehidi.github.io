<h1>My Favorite Thing</h1>
<p>I love doing my favourite thing and there have not been a single day in the history of ever when I gave up on doing it at least twice a day, come what may.

Doing what I love gives me a sense of who I actually am, it decides on my emotional background state,which is happy, when I'm happy the mind works just right, most importantly, it gives me the powerful wave of energy to carry on with my least favourite but important things.

Some of my favorite things to do are.</p>

  <p>Of all the outdoor games, my most favorite is cricket. This game has been popularly accepted in India in recent years since India’s good performance in international cricket.

The game of Cricket is played on a large oval-shaped ground. Each team comprises of eleven players. After the toss, players of one team goes for batting and the players of the other team bowl in turn. Also, there are fielders who stop balls and return it. The batmen starts batting and defend the deliveries of the bowlers.

The game may be of a One-day match or a Test-match for five days. The duration for test-matches are generally five days. In a test match, each team gets two innings to play. In a One-day match (also limited overs cricket), each team typically gets 50 overs to play. In case of Twenty20 format, the team bowls for 20 overs each. The Twenty20 cricket format is also played for one day and the results are declared on the same day. The team that scores more runs wins the match.

The captains of both the teams play significant role in such a game. There are two umpires whose opinion and decision are to be accepted by the players of both the teams.

Like other games, cricket is also a toilsome game and the practice of it keeps the players fit and healthy physically. Excellent team spirit and sense of discipline can be developed by joining and practicing this game. Deep concentration and determination are necessary to gain perfection. This game is regarded as the valuable and dignified one.</P>

  <p>I have always been a big reader. Even at a young age, you were more likely to find me reading than watching TV (the only rival to my reading would have been colouring books.)

I have loved going on different adventures, falling in love with characters and loving to hate the villains. I’ve been thinking back to the books that have stayed with me even years after I’ve stopped reading the last page and in this new feature, I wanted to share some of my favourites with you.

One of the books that has stayed with me, is Harry Potter & The Prisoner of Azkaban by JK Rowling.

I was late coming to the Harry Potter series. I think the books came to my attention when browsing in a book shop one day around the same time that the first film had appeared in cinemas. As the film had just been released, I’d been hearing a lot about the series (or the books that had been released up to that point,) and I was intrigued so I picked up the first book in the series. Let’s just say, within three days, I had to buy the rest. One of the things I love about this book series in particular is that it appeals to all ages and covers a variety of themes. I am fascinated by how these seven books all interconnect – how a small piece of information in the first book, like the fact that the wands are brothers is the thing that ends up saving his life later on.


I loved The Philosopher’s Stone and Chamber of Secrets, don’t get my wrong but there was something about The Prisoner of Azkaban that I just adored and this is why it’s one, if not my favourite of the series (very closely followed by Goblet of Fire despite the fact that the end scared the hell out of me.)

This book has a great plot. It is a lot darker than the two books which preceded it. In my opinion, the series and plot begin to evolve in this book. It feels a little more realistic (well, as realistic as a story about a magical world can get.) There are resolutions. Questions are answered but it also creates questions too. The ending isn’t as tied up as it was with previous books. There is a proper cliffhanger which pulled me toward the next book.

Everything starts to get a little bit more complicated for Harry. You gain more information about what happened the night his parents died and I just remember not being able to wait to be able to sit and get engrossed in this book.

This book is so atmospheric, heartbreaking and bittersweet all at the same time (the film captures this book really well.) It covers friendship, betrayal and love – a wide range of emotions and I admit that I did cry a little.

I did always love school but I would have adored it if I got to go to Hogwarts and be a witch and learn how to fly and study magic. I want to go to school in this book (minus all the danger, obviously.)</p>

    <p> My  favourite movie is 3 Idiots.This is a story of the three engineering students in Imperial College of Engineering who finds their friendship as making themselves like idiots but learning from it. The main casts were Farhan Qureshi acted by R. Madhavan, Raju Rastogi acted by Sharman Joshi and Ranchoddas Shamaldas “Rancho” Chanchad acted by Aamir Khan.The main reason why I like love film, inspite of being a comedy carries a message and it’s about humanity. Other than that, I like this movie because it conveys about our schooling system. Nowadays, rote memorization isn't the only thing,it is the understanding of the subject that is needed more than that. It also conveys about expectations of parents and teachers from students. That it is about what one truly enjoys doing than to do what earns more. That grades are not everything.Moreover,In this movie it shows me that we must care and love our family. I really love my family. I always keep my promises for them, to raise them from poverty and to travel with them around the world. What I wanted for my family is to make them happy. Like Raju,we just want to free our family from poor quality that we had. Still I am happy though my family is striving crisis, because I believe that what important is, you are together with your family and you are having fun. This film influences me so much especially the quote “All is well” that always comes out from the mouth of Rancho. I belives that whatever circumstances may lead, if there is any obstacle I may encounter, I will just say this and I will be calm because I believes that there must be a solution in every problem.</p>
